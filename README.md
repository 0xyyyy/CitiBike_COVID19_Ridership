Link to Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/profile/yuta3086#!/vizhome/Citi_Bike_PrePostCovidUsage/Dashboard2
Purpose: To create a dashboard exploring the difference in peak ride times and most popular start stations in June of 2016 vs. June of 2020. 

##### Takeaways: 
- Peak ride times prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were highest during commute times: 6-10am and 4-8pm. After the COVID-19 outbreak Peak ride times had a similar spike around 4-8pm but ridership during morning commute hours was significantly lower. 

- In both June of 2016 and June of 2020 ridership was greater in Males than in Females 
- Ridership originating from JC Medical Center increased during COVID-19 compared to before COVID-19. This could be due to influx of COVID-19 patients and family members/staff members leaving the medical center to surrounding areas.
